      <p>This website emulates the experience of reading when it rains in the city. My favorite time to do work/read is when it’s raining light–the sound of a busy city is muffled, the plants are supplied with water and growing, all the activities just kind of pause.
        In order to emulate the experience of rain, I added the audio of rain. The audio was acquired from https://freesound.org/ and I mixed the two tracks of light rain and bird sound together using Adobe Premier, then exported it in mp4 format. The “paper” is emulated by having it in center, with its alignment set to justify. I originally wanted to emulate the animation of flipping pages, but half way through, I realized that this is a website design, not a game, so I went with this. In times, as I grow more comfortable with html, css and javascript, I might added more intricate and suitable visual/sensory elements to the webpage.</p>
